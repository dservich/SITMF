What is SITMF, you ask? SITMF is a site dedicated to providing its users
 with news, and a way for them to voice their opinions through video about
  it. Users can also view fellow user’s opinions to try and see different 
  stances on topics. Not sure what your stance is on a certain subject? 
  Simply type in a keyword and see the subject through someone else’s point
   of view. Why read someone’s point of view written from behind a keyboard
    when you can have them say it to your face?
